# Stream : an implementation of the PFEM for incompressible free-surface flows.

> [!NOTE] Stream 
> A continuous flow of fluid.
> A continuous flow of data or instructions.

This library aims at providing a parallel implementation for all building blocks 
of the Particle Finite Element Method pipeline :

- Mesh computation
- Free-surface detection
- Mesh adaptation
- Assembly of the linear system of equations 
- Solution of the system

If you'd rather use your own mesher : you can supply you mesh to the library.
And if you'd rather use your own solver : the matrix is assembled in CSR and can be retrieved.
